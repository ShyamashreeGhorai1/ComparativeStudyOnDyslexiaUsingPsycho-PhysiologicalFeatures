# ComparativeStudyOnDyslexiaUsingPsycho-PhysiologicalFeatures
 Dyslexia is the most common neurological learning disability. It’s linked to genes, which 
 is why the condition runs in families.Early detection of Dyslexia will be very useful as it
 can be avoided a high rates of academic failure. So , if we predict Dyslexia as early as 
 possible then doctor can start the treatment soon. We conduct a Comparative study of different
 features for prediction analysis of Dyslexia.
 ## Summary
 Developed different machine learning approach to detect dyslexia using different feature selection method.
 Feature selection method: 1) Selected features using mutual information gain. 2) Selected phonological 
 awareness related features. we analysed different features for prediction analysis of Dyslexia for model
 improvement. 
 ## About the Dataset
 Used game dataset. In this game, there are mainly 32 questions and 3644 participants with an age range of 7 
 to 17 years old. To quantify task performance, there are 6 dependent measures – i) number of Clicks ii) number 
 of correct answers(Hits) iii) number of incorrect answers(Misses) iv) Score defined as sum of Hits per set of 
 exercises v) Accuracy, defined as the number of Hits divided by the number of Clicks (vi) Missrate, defined as
 the number of Misses divided by the number of Clicks
